# axiosflow-api: a backend library for effortless api development and integration

It's a server-side library that is aimed at making it easier to create APIs using TypeScript with express by providing a structured way of defining routes, adding middlewares, and generating API schema on the fly in order to make your development easy.

This library works in perfect harmony with the axiosflow CLI on the frontend, whereby you can generate type-safe API function calls with it pretty fast. It also tends to make the code highly consistent and quickens your development cycles.

# Key Benefits

### Effortless Route Management:
Use decorators and metadata to register routes, in such a way that the API code doesn't get cluttered.

### Powerful Middleware Integration:
Easily implement middleware authentication, logging, and error handling to further streamline the capabilities of your API.

### Dynamic API Schema Generation:
Automatically export API schema data which can be consumed by axiosflow to easily generate client functions.

### Type Safety and Client Function Generation:
Ensure type-safe communication between your backend and frontend, minimizing runtime errors.

## Ideal For
- Building modern RESTful APIs  
- Microservices architectures  
- Rapid API development and prototyping
